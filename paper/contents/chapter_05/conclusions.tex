\section{Conclusions}

We have presented EMS-GT2, an improved exact solution for the planted-motif search problem. EMS-GT2 was able to efficiently test candidate motifs in block by filtering out $l$-mers using a property of the search space array that we have discovered. The previous implementation of EMS-GT already outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm qPMS9 in $(l, d)$-challenge instances $(9, 2)$, $(11, 3)$, $(13, 4)$ and $(15, 5)$ but failed to beat qPMS9 in $(17, 6)$-challenge instance. EMS-GT2 improved the algorithm's performance on $(13, 4)$, $(15, 5)$ and $(17, 6)$ and was able to beat qPMS9 in all $(l, d)$-challenge instances where $l \leq 17$.
