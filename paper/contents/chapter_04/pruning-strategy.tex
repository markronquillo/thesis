\section{Pruning strategy in Neighborhood Generation of a Sequence}
% rephrase
EMS-GT generates the $d$-neighborhood of a sequence by collecting all the $d$-neighbors of every $l$-mer in the sequence. 

% rephrase
It is obvious that identical $l$-mers has a hamming distance of 0 and will generate the same $d$-neighborhood. Thus we only need to generate the $d$-neighborhood of distinct $l$-mers in a sequence. This observation can be extended into a pruning strategy as we process the neighborhood generation of $l$-mers in a sequence.
