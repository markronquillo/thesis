\section{Block flags implementation in Generate phase}

The EMS-GT algorithm follows the pattern-driven approach where it exhaustively tests the $4^l$ bit-array of possible motifs. It quickly filters the $4^l$ bit-array in the Generate phase by intersecting the $d$-neighborhood of the first $n'$ sequences. To be specific, EMS-GT maintains two $4^l$ bit-array during the Generate phase. The first array holds the remaining candidate motifs and the second array holds the $d$-neighborhood of the current sequence. For every sequence in the first $n'$ sequences, we generate the $d$-neighborhood by blocks then interects it with the candidate motifs array, the resulting set will be the new candidate motifs array. We observed that at some point in the Generation phase, candidate motifs array has numerous empty blocks of $l$-mers. Applying block masks in this part of the neighbordhood array will be useless since we already know that there is no candidate motifs in that block. An efficient way is to focus the neighborhood generation on those blocks where there are still candidate motifs. We have implemented a block flags strategy that tracks these empty blocks in the candidate motifs array.
