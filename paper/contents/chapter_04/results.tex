This section describes the speedup techniques introduced in this study and briefly discusses the observations where the idea for the improvements originated. This also describes the speedup techniques incorporated in the EMS-GT2 algorithm. Lastly, evaluation of runtime performance of the EMS-GT2, EMS-GT and qPMS9 was also discussed in this section.
