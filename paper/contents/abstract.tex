Finding DNA motifs is a widely studied area in the field of Computational Biology. Motifs signify different information that are useful for biologists like discovering transcription factor-binding sites and helps them identify potential therapeutic drug target. One variation of the motif finding problem is called the $(l, d)$-motif search or Planted Motif Search problem (PMS). In this paper, we propose the EMS-GT2 algorithm, an extension of the Exact Motif Search - Generate and Test (EMS-GT) which is an exact enumerative algorithm for PMS. In EMS-GT2, we incorporated a new speedup technique that is based on an important property that we have discovered, which we prove in this paper, and which has enabled a more efficient block-processing of candidate motifs. We also explored a way to improve the $d$-neighborhood generation by focusing on non empty blocks in the candidate motifs array. We improved the Hamming distance computation by pre-computing mismatch values. Our C++ implementation of EMS-GT2 running on synthetic data for several PMS challenge instances demonstrate that it is competitive with both the EMS-GT and qPMS9, the two current best exact solutions for PMS. In particular, EMS-GT2 is able to reduce the run-times of EMS-GT by 17.02\%, 18.13\%, 25.67\%, 14.13\% and 21.65\% for the (l,d) challenge instances (9, 2), (11, 3), (13, 4), (15, 5) and (17, 6) respectively. It also outperforms qPMS9, having runtime reductions of 93.97\%, 89.02\%, 82.24\%, 57.29\% and 5.00\% for the (9, 2), (11, 3), (13, 4), (15, 5) and (17, 6) synthetic challenge instances respectively.
