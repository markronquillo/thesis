\section{Research questions}

This study aims to answer the main question: How can the EMS-GT be improved to handle challenging instances more efficiently?

These are the supporting sub-questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How can the block-related partitioning of the set of $l$-mers in the EMS-GT be exploited to improve the Generation and Test phases of the EMS-GT?

	\item Can some Hamming distance pre-computation be developed to further speedup the EMS-GT?

	\item How does the proposed improved version compare with the state-of-the-art motif search algorithms EMS-GT and qPMS9?

	% \item What is the runtime performance of the proposed EMS-GT2 on the synthetic datasets?

	% \item What is the performance of the proposed EMS-GT2 compared to its predecessor EMS-GT and to qPMS9 algorithm?	
\end{enumerate}
