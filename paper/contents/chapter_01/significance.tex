Motif signifies important information that are useful in the field of Computational Biology. Finding these motifs, which is already proven as NP-Complete problem, requires creative, fast and efficient algorithms. Improving an already established and competitive algorithm in the motif finding is one way to contribute to this field.

EMS-GT algorithm is competitive and able to beat state-of-the-art algorithms like PMS8 and qPMS9 in a certain range of problem instances. Improving EMS-GT in such a way that it can beat other algorithms in different problem instances will make it a more viable option in practical motif finding applications. In addition, the improved way of hamming distance computation and the discovered properties of the data structure that EMS-GT2 use may prove useful in other algorithm solutions that use such data structure.
