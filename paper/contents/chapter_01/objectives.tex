\section{Objectives of the study}

This study aims to improve the runtime performance of the EMS-GT algorithm and propose a new version of the algorithm, referred to as the EMS-GT2 algorithm. The objectives of the study are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To explore additional speedup techniques that may be used to improve the runtime performance of the EMS-GT algorithm.

	\item To evaluate the runtime performance of the proposed EMS-GT2 algorithm using synthetic datasets.

	\item To compare the performance of the EMS-GT2 against its predecessor EMS-GT and the qPMS9 algorithm using synthetic datasets.
\end{enumerate}
