\section{Objectives of the study}

This study aims to improve the runtime performance of the EMS-GT algorithm and proposing a new version of the algorithm, which is the EMS-GT2 algorithm. The objectives of the study are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To explore more speedup techniques to improve the runtime performance of the EMS-GT algorithm.

	\item To evaluate the runtime performance of the proposed EMS-GT2 algorithm.

	\item To evaluate EMS-GT2 against its predecessor EMS-GT and the qPMS9 algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
