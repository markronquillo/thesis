# qPMS9

This project includes an efficient parallel algorithm for quorum Planted Motif Search (qPMS). Planted Motif Search (PMS) receives as input n biological sequences and two integers L and D. It returns all possible sequences M of length L such that M occurs in each of the input strings, and each occurrence of M differs from M in no more than D positions. A more practically usable formulation is called quorum PMS (qPMS), which allows the motif to appear in at least q% of the input strings. Therefore, PMS is a special case of qPMS, where q=100%.

This algorithm is described in the following publication

## Source code

See the [qpms9](qpms9) folder for qPMS9 source code and details on how to compile/run.

See the [qpms9-data](qpms9-data) folder for dataset generator source code. 

## Precompiled Windows binaries

You can find precompiled windows binaries in the [examples/win](examples/win) folder.
These have been compiled on Windows 7 using MinGW. 

* Precompiled qpms9 windows executable without parallel execution (no MPI) can be found [here](examples/win/qpms9-nompi.exe?raw=true).

* Precompiled windows [dataset generator](qpms9-data) can be found [here](examples/win/qpms9-data.exe?raw=true). 

Please consult the [examples/win](examples/win) for sample input/output and scripts to run the programs.
